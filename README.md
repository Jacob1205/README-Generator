## Installation Instructions

You can install the application by cloning it to your local machine. Run the command git clone. Once you have succesfully cloned the app to your local machine, you can then remove the existing README.md and run the index.js file in your VSCode terminal. Installation of the node dependency 'Inquirer' is required.

## Usage Information

After the application has been installed, run it using node index. You will then be prompted with a series of questions about the contents of your markdown file. After the last prompt is answered, the program will write to a new file called README.md.
